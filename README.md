# gentar_status_updater
An application to migrate the state of a phenotyping plan in GenTaR 

This project was written using python 3.9.4
and has been tested on OSX

## 1. Check your python installation:

```
python --version
```

## 2. Create a virtual environment for the project (requires Python 3.4+)

```
cd <name_of_cloned_github_repository>
python -m venv venv
```

## 3. To begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

## 4. Install the packages required for the project

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---
## 5. Prepare to run the program.

### A) Edit the colonies.txt file.

Add each colony to be updated on a separate line and save the file.
e.g.
```
JR34077
JR34293
```
### B) Export environment variable with your user credential.
```
export GENTAR_USER=<username>
export GENTAR_PASSWORD=<gentar_password>
```
### C) Specify the service to update.
```
export GENTAR_ENV=SANDBOX
```
Note: You can use the <a href="https://www.gentar.org/production-tracker-sandbox/#/">SANDBOX</a> to test the update.
Use "export GENTAR_ENV=PRODUCTION" to update the main service.

---
## 5. Once you have finished working in the virtual environment clean up

```
deactivate
```

This puts you back to the systemâ€™s default Python interpreter
with all its installed libraries.
